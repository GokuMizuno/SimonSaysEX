# SimonSaysEX

This is a simple simon says like program written in Notepad and debugged using the ideaone.com C# compiler.

I am using an online compiler as my current VS2013 compiler is unavailable for use, and I cannot install it on the machine I am currently using.

This program will be a simple simon-says like memory app.  There are 4 buttons, RYGB, which light up.  The human player then has to repeat the sequence correctly.  The player earns one point for each button correctly pressed.
